      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p>The ”Run the risk” marketing campaign is based on the values and vision of the company, the beliefs and the idea behind the brand as well as the desired target group preferences. With the promotion of the brand and later the product itself, we strive to develop brand awareness, target a desired audience and build a good communicational relationship with our customers/followers. As a completely new brand, we set the reach objective of gathering at least 100 followers as well as to reach of at least 1000 accounts for the period of around 3 weeks. </p>
      <p>The brand vision is to make people get out of their comfort zone and motivate them in order to become their best self. To achieve that the campaign message is based on motivating and giving the little push to the ones who are scared to take the risk. The campaign started with a teasing post and an introduction of the brand, so we can build relationship with our followers. Then the product was revealed and motivational posts as well as stories and reels took over in order to achieve the reach objective. Each post has a clear description with a motivational quote from the brand and the little push to make the people get out and achieve their dreams.</p>
      <p>The Instagram platform provides us the opportunity to use all kinds of posting, such as stories, reels, pictures, this gives us the chance to reach as many people as possible within our target group and have a very strong presence on the platform. At the same time you can receive and send direct messages and develop the desired communication as stated above.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p>With the ending of the campaign, some of our objectives were achieved, but some were not, at the same time for our group, it was a first time experience managing and working on a business social media page, where we had to represent the brands values and vision and not ourselves. Because of that reason, we were feeling unsure about the amount of followers we can get so we set a goal that we thought is achievable, but also reaches enough people and sets a solid beginning for the internet presence of the brand – 100 followers and a reach of 1000 impressions/views. As mentioned, we were aware that gaining a lot of followers and reach is much harder than what most people expect and later it turned out to be true.</p>
      <p>As of 13th of April, a day before the deadline our brands Instаgram page has 70 followers or in other words we achieved 70% of the initial objective of reaching a 100 page followers, prove can be seen in appendix and/or website corporate page. On the other hand, we have our objective of reaching 1000 different accounts, here we managed to reach over 6600 accounts or we achieved more than 600% of our initial objective. This leads us to the fact that gaining followers that want to stick with the brands page and content is much harder and valuable than the reach factor. That due to the fact that most of the reached accounts won`t see our posts again, but the followers are the ones who actually want to engage with the brand, proof and screenshots are again available in the appendix and/or the website corporate page. (Disclosure: Those numbers were achieved without the use of Instagram advertising or other promotional tools.)
        We posted a total of five posts, six stories and two reels (videos). The provided screenshots in the appendix/website clearly show how much better videos (reels) did instead of the posts. Both of our videos reached over 3000 accounts, on their own, while the most engaging post we shared only achieved 71 reached accounts. </p>
      <p>In order to be completely open about how the brands page did – many of the followers we achieved were family, friends, people that we know or other business accounts similar to ours. Achieving actual followers turned out to be even harder than expected, but we believe that with more consistency, regular posts, more reels and more structured planning of the type of posts we want share, achieving more actual followers can happen. </p>
      <p>In order to sum everything what we learned in a couples of sentences we would say that: a promotional campaign on a social media platform is much harder than expected, even though we already had this in mind. Second – the planning should be much more structured and detailed, at the same time we realized that having as much time as possible is crucial so this is why we would start way earlier with posting for future projects. Third- gaining followers is way more important than the reach and what`s even more important is that those followers are actual people that are interested in the content. We still think using just one platform is completely enough if the presence is solid and all features of the platform are used correctly.</p>  
      <h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p>As already touched upon in the Learning points, here we are about to explain what would we do if we had to continue the campaign. As said, one think would keep is the use of just one social media platform, specifically Instagram. We believe that this platform provides everything needed for a hugely successful social media promotion campaign – features such as direct messaging, bio where to put website or something that represents the brand, shopping feature, Reels (videos), stories, posts, meaningful and specific insights – basically we think that Instagram manages to combine all available other platforms together successfully.</p>
      <p>Now, on to the part about what would we change and do different for the future. Firstly – a much more structured planning combined with posting only on the times with most engagement time according to our research and the provided table in the appendix. This can boost each post and therefore the whole page and at the same time is something simple and easy to be done. We would as well make use of a publishing tool that can post for us on specific dates we set with the largest engagement rates. Secondly – using more the insights and basing our future content on the engagement rate and focusing on the type of posts the does the best. This leads to the third change – creating and posting more reels, each post can easily be transformed into a video, which would reach more people and the brand would get more attention. Fourth change that we would make is to communicate better with our followers, so ask them questions, create surveys, ask them to comment or give opinion, this can help us achieve our objective of creating a community.</p>
